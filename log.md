# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did 1 hour in the evening, learned what a callback function is, reduce() method and did 2 codewars challenges, kyu 8 and 7(javascript)

**Thoughts:** Feeling like starting to get the hang of Javascript, at least the basics. I know it's just the beginning though, the darkest and thoughest things are still to come i think.
