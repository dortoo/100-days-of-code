# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did 1 hour in the evening, learned what a callback function is, reduce() method and did 2 codewars challenges, kyu 8 and 7(javascript)

**Thoughts:** Feeling like starting to get the hang of Javascript, at least the basics. I know it's just the beginning though, the darkest and thoughest things are still to come i think.


### Day 1: January 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 1 hour in the evening again, worked on Exercise 3 of Chapter 4(Eloquent Javascript). Pretty hard exercise, but starting to get the grasp of how to start building the program.

**Thoughts:** Pretty big jump in difficulty with this exercise. I like it because i can test new things and see which one works and which one doesn't.


### Day 2: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 1 hour in the eve, still on Exercise 3 of Chapter 4. Have to learn how to transform an array into an object, and to increasingly add more objects as the for loop does its looping(to create an object list).

**Thoughts:** Elon Musk said once "life is about learning to ask the right questions" and it's what i did today. Got through some stack overflow questions, learned new things, getting closer and closer to solving it :)
